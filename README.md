# ðŸ“„ PDFMaker

**PDFMaker** is a simple Streamlit-based web application that allows users to generate custom printable notebooks in PDF format. Users can input topics and assign a number of pages to each, then generate a structured PDF where each topic begins its own section.

This project was built as part of a self-guided learning journey, combining skills learned across multiple lessons. It demonstrates how front-end input (Streamlit) and back-end document generation (FPDF) can work together in a functional Python app.
